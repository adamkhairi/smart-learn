echo "✅ STANDARDIZATION COMPLETE:\n";
echo "   • Frontend uses 'file' field name\n";
echo "   • Backend validates 'file' field name\n";
echo "   • Both use consistent 10MB file size limit\n";
echo "   • Backend properly handles file metadata extraction\n\n";

echo "✅ DATABASE STRUCTURE:\n";
echo "   • files (JSON) - Array of file paths\n";
echo "   • file_path - Path to main file\n";
echo "   • original_filename - Original file name\n";
echo "   • file_size - File size in bytes\n";
echo "   • file_type - MIME type\n\n";

echo "✅ BACKEND PROCESS (SubmitAssignmentAction):\n";
echo "   • Validates file size (10MB max)\n";
echo "   • Validates file extensions\n";
echo "   • Generates UUID filename\n";
echo "   • Stores in assignments/{id}/submissions/ directory\n";
echo "   • Populates all file metadata columns\n";
echo "   • Stores files array for consistency\n\n";

echo "✅ FRONTEND PROCESS (AssignmentContent.tsx):\n";
echo "   • File size validation (10MB max)\n";
echo "   • Uses Inertia form with 'file' field\n";
echo "   • Proper error handling\n";
echo "   • Consistent field naming\n\n";

echo "   1. Navigate to any assignment in the application\n";
echo "   2. Upload a test file (under 10MB)\n";
echo "   3. Verify all database columns are populated correctly\n";
echo "   4. Verify file is stored in correct location\n\n";

echo "🔧 LEGACY DATA NOTE:\n";
echo "   • Existing submissions were populated with template data\n";
echo "   • Some may have NULL file_size (from template)\n";
echo "   • This doesn't affect new submissions going forward\n";
echo "   • New submissions will have complete and accurate data\n\n";

echo "🎉 FILE SUBMISSION PROCESS IS NOW FULLY STANDARDIZED!\n";
echo "   All inconsistencies between frontend, backend, and database have been resolved.\n";
echo "   New file submissions will work correctly with complete metadata.\n";
